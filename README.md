# AES-CUDA-Kernels

This repository provides a GPU-accelerated solution for AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption and decryption processes. By utilizing the power of the GPU, the 'aes_encrypt_kernel.cu' and 'aes_decrypt_kernel.cu' files offer significant performance improvements over traditional CPU-based implementations.

## Features

- GPU-accelerated AES encryption and decryption
- Improved performance and speed
- Easy integration into existing projects
- Support for 256-bit AES keys
- Efficient memory management for optimal GPU utilization
